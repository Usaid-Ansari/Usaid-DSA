Array → Functions → Recursion → Sorting/Searching → Stack & Queue → Linked List → Backtracking → Trees → Graphs → DP


Recursion:
-Function thats calls itself again and again (Function ka apne aap ko again and again call karna)
-It is another call Self Referncing call
- it uses stack 
- More memory 
- performance  will be lower because of stack


Type of Recursion 
- Head 
- Tail
- Tree
- Nested

=> HEAD : Recusive call is at first statment of Function
=> TAIL : Recursive call is in the last statment
=> TREE : Recursive function calling itself more than one time
=> NESTED : Recursive function will be passed as parametr in a recursive call
